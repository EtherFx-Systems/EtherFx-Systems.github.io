    <h1>EtherFx - The simple way to do distributed systems</h1>
    <p>EtherFx allows users to perform computationally expensive tasks more efficiently, by distributing the execution of the computation onto multiple nodes over a network.
        By including the EtherFx library in the userâ€™s Python environment and all functions imported from the EtherFx will be able to be executed on a cluster of servers running the EtherFx server application.</p>
